Introduction

The RAC project uses the alignment-assembly algorithm to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in antibiotic-resistant (AR) genes that were identified from a specific strain. 

In detail, this program filters out the unmapped sequences from a strain that was aligned through a sequencer (Illumina MiSeq). The program will have to identify what AR genes are present by finding similarities against a locally maintained Antibiotic Resistant Database (ARDB) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). After identifying the AR genes present in the strain, the high scoring sequences are then assembled under the particular AR gene sequence it belongs, using the CLC Genomics Workbench. Besides assembly, CLC provides a visual mapping of the assembled sequences as well as a summarized tabular format. Thus making it particularly easy to detect SNPs and interpret the results.

assemble_hit_files.py - Generate files to be assembled against specific AR genes identified by BLAST
/Data/Database/create_database.py - Creates standalone BLAST Antibiotic Resistance Database (ARDB)


System Requirements

All of the applications or software listed below are required, unless it is marked as optional, to be able to run the program. It is important to read the installation guide for each software as some of the softwares listed require other softwares to be installed in order for it to work properly. Lastly, select the correct version for your computer’s operating system.

- Current release is Python 2.7.5. It is highly recommended to remain in Python 2.7 series as other python modules and softwares used in this program does not support the Python 3 series.
- This program was written entirely in Python.
- Download Python at http://www.python.org/download/releases/ to be able to launch the program.

Biopython
- Biopython is a free tool for computational biology written in Python that includes tools and Python libraries for projects in bioinformatics.
- For links to tutorial and more about Biopython, visit http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page.
- Download the installer at http://biopython.org/wiki/Download.

SAMtools
- Current release is SAMtools 0.1.19
- SAMtools is used to manipulate alignments in SAM/BAM file format.

phpMyAdmin (optional)
- Current release phpMyAdmin 3.5.2.2
- phpMyAdmin is a free software used for MySQL administration. This software is marked as optional as the program can run even without this program.
- For more information and the installation link of phpMyAdmin, visit http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php.


CLC Genomics Workbench
- CLC Genomics Workbench is not necessarily required to run the program but it is required to complete the final step of the project which is to be able to know if SNPs exists from the identified antibiotic resistance genes. 
- This is a licensed software that needs to be purchased.
